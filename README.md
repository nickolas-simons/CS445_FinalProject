In order to run the code yourself, run all in the "main.ipynb" file

The "corner_detection_utils.py" contians the code for the 3 corner detection implementations  
The "piece_detection_utils.py" contains the code for the piece detection implementation

"Test_Images" Folder contains the images used for results

"Real_Board_Values" Folder contains calculated board states by us in order to cross-check the methods.

The 6 other folders contain the corners data from each method (1 folder per method), and an image that plots the calculated corners onto the original image (1 folder per method)
